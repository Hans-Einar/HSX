# Architecture View â€” Mailbox Subsystem

## Role & Responsibilities
- Provide message queues/mailboxes for HSX tasks and services.
- Support multiple namespaces (svc, app, shared) with configurable delivery modes.
- Deliver stdio bindings and telemetry fan-out.

## Interfaces
- SVC module 0x05 operations: open, bind, send, recv, peek, tap.
- Descriptor pool managed by executive; handles scoped per task.
- Event notifications (wait/wake/error) emitted to executive and tooling.

## Relationships
- Core IPC channel between HSX tasks and host/external services.
- Value/command subsystem can publish via mailbox taps.
- Shell/debugger listen to mailboxes for stdio and telemetry.

## Notes
- Inspired by VMS/RSX-11 mailboxes with fan-out/tap semantics.
- Supports blocking semantics so tasks sleep without busy loops.
- Embedded profiles can scale descriptor pool to device constraints.
