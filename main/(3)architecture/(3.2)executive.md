# Architecture View â€” Executive

## Role & Responsibilities
- Coordinate MiniVM tasks: scheduling, attach/detach, run control.
- Provide IPC services (mailboxes), stdio routing, and HAL bindings.
- Expose RPC interface to shell/debugger clients.
- Manage provisioning of HSX apps and FRAM persistence.

## Interfaces
- RPC protocol (JSON over TCP) as in docs/executive_protocol.md.
- Control commands: ping, info, load, attach, step, clock, trace, ps, sched, mailbox ops.
- Event stream for debug/trace notifications.
- HAL hooks for UART, CAN, FRAM, filesystem.

## Relationships
- Owns MiniVM instance(s) and selects active task per time slice.
- Relies on toolchain outputs (.hxe) for task images.
- Serves shell, debugger, provisioning clients via network or local transport.

## Notes
- PID-scoped sessions ensure exclusive control per debugger.
- Event fan-out model underpins debugger and telemetry tooling.
- Designed for Python implementation first, with roadmap to native C port on embedded targets.
