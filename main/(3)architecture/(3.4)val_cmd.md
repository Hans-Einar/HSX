# Architecture View â€” Value & Command Access Layer

## Role & Responsibilities
- Expose HSX app data points (values) for external observation/control.
- Provide zero-argument commands for mode switching, calibration, diagnostics.
- Bridge values/commands to shell, CAN, mailbox, and persistence layers.

## Interfaces
- SVC module 0x07 (values) and 0x08 (commands).
- Numeric addressing via group:value IDs with optional human-readable names.
- CAN/UART/mailbox bindings defined in docs/hsx_value_interface.md.

## Relationships
- Values sourced from HSX tasks; executive mediates access and persistence.
- Commands trigger task-defined handlers; security enforced via flags/tokens.
- Tooling (shell, debugger, CAN gateways) rely on this layer for observability.

## Notes
- Values are f16-based; bool represented as 0/1 to minimise footprint.
- Per-value metadata optional; runtime keeps compact records to save RAM.
- Persistence via FRAM keys enables calibration/state retention across power cycles.
