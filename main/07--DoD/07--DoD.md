# Definition of Done â€” HSX Project Architecture

> Use this checklist to confirm the project-level design package is complete and implementation-ready.

## Documentation
- [ ] `(1)mandate.md` approved by stakeholders.
- [ ] `(2)study.md` reflects current feasibility assessment and decisions.
- [ ] `(3)architecture.md` aligns with `docs/hsx_spec-v2.md` and milestone roadmap.
- [ ] `(4.1)system_design.md` and `(4.2)toolkit_design.md` reviewed and baselined.

## Traceability
- [ ] Requirements in feature/refactor packages trace back to project-level design.
- [ ] Milestone plan in `MILESTONES.md` references architecture components and dependencies.

## Implementation Readiness
- [ ] Core refactor packages (e.g., `refactor/#01_CoreFunctionality`) derive their objectives from this design.
- [ ] Tooling initiatives (e.g., debugger playbook) confirm required system APIs exist or are scheduled.
- [ ] Risk mitigation plans captured in study/design docs have owners and timelines.

## Sign-off
- [ ] Project owner approval recorded.
- [ ] Technical leads acknowledge documentation as baseline for implementation.
