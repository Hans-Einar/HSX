# Design Document Set

Detailed design specs live here; each file expands on the corresponding architecture view.

- (4.1)vm.md — MiniVM internals.
- (4.2)executive.md — Executive control and RPC implementation.
- (4.3)mailbox.md — Mailbox data structures and flows.
- (4.4)val_cmd.md — Value/command runtime implementation.
- (4.5)toolchain.md — LLVM lowering, assembler, linker, packaging.
- (4.6)toolkit.md — Shell/debugger internals.
- (4.7)provisioning.md — Provisioning and persistence mechanisms.

Add further specs (HAL, security) when deeper design work begins.
