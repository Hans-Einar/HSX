# Project Design Overview â€” HSX Runtime & Tooling

> Summarise how the architecture decomposes into detailed designs. Sub-documents provide comprehensive specifications.

## Design Layers
- **System Design (`(4.1)system_design.md`):** MiniVM, executive, mailbox subsystem, scheduling strategies, event/breakpoint infrastructure, and pathways for future C porting.
- **Toolkit Design (`(4.2)toolkit_design.md`):** Shell, debugger (CLI/TUI), supporting scripts, packaging, and documentation flows.

## Design Guidelines
- Maintain clear separation between runtime services (system) and host tooling (toolkit) while defining stable interfaces between them.
- Document preconditions/postconditions per subsystem to ensure implementation can be validated against requirements.
- Use milestone planning to stage design rollout (e.g., align debugger design with Milestone 6+).

## Traceability
- Map requirements from `main/(2)study.md` and feature-level requirement docs to the corresponding sections in system/toolkit designs.
- Ensure DoD checklists reference design completion before implementation tasks begin.

## Design Playbook
- [ ] Complete MiniVM design spec (`(4)design/(4.1)vm.md`)
