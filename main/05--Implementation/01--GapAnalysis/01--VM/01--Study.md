# Gap Analysis: VM

## 1. Scope Recap

_Brief synopsis of the design document and links back to the design specification._

**Design Reference:** [04.01--VM.md](../../../04--Design/04.01--VM.md)

**Summary:**  
The MiniVM design specifies a "dumb machine" that implements the HSX instruction-set architecture (ISA) for single-task execution on both Python reference and embedded C targets. The VM is always executive-driven in productionâ€”it performs no autonomous scheduling, context switching, or HAL work. Key design tenets include:

- **Deterministic execution** with workspace-pointer-based O(1) context switching
- **Complete ISA implementation** covering data movement, integer ALU, control flow, floating-point helpers (f16), and system services (SVC)
- **Executive-driven control plane** with narrow API for orchestration (load, step, clock, register/memory access)
- **Trap interface** for syscalls (SVC), breakpoints (BRK), and faults
- **HXE format support** with both monolithic and streaming loaders
- **Debug infrastructure** including trace records and register inspection
- **ABI compliance** with standard calling conventions and stack management

## 3. Missing or Partial Coverage

_Gaps that block full compliance with the design._

**Open Items:**
- **C embedded port (DR-1.3, DG-1.4):** Design specifies Python reference **and** C port for embedded targets. No C implementation exists yet in `platforms/`. This is critical for deployment on MCU targets (STM32, etc.)
- **Shift operations (LSL, LSR, ASR):** Study document (`main/02--Study/02--Study.md`) identifies shift operations as part of "minimal instruction set" needed for LLVM lowering and C compilation. Essential for bit manipulation, efficient multiply/divide by powers of 2, and C bitfield operations. Currently missing from ISA.
- **Carry-aware arithmetic (ADC, SBC):** Study document identifies add-with-carry and subtract-with-borrow as part of minimal instruction set. Required for multi-precision arithmetic (e.g., 64-bit operations on 32-bit architecture). Current ISA has ADD/SUB but no carry variants.
- **PSW flag implementation (C, N, V):** Design spec (section 4.3) defines processor status word with Z (zero), C (carry), N (negative), and V (overflow) flags. Current implementation only sets Z flag (line 770 in `host_vm.py`). C, N, V flags are not computed or maintained by any arithmetic/logic operations.
- **DIV opcode (0x13):** Design spec includes DIV in opcode table, but implementation in `host_vm.py` currently skips from MUL (0x12) to AND (0x14). Integer division is missing.
- **Streaming HXE loader (6.1.2):** Design specifies `vm_load_{begin,write,end,abort}` for byte-granularity ingestion. Current implementation only supports monolithic loading via full HXE buffer. Streaming is essential for CAN/UART provisioning on low-RAM targets.
- **Optional code/data paging (4.4, 6.1.4):** Design includes code cache lines (256-512B) and data TLB (2-4 entries) for memory-constrained targets. Not implemented; all code/data must fit in RAM.
- **SETPSW/GETPSW opcodes:** Design section 4.1 mentions "future SETPSW/GETPSW" for system helpers but these are not defined in opcode table or implemented
- **Heap support (6.1.5):** HXE header includes optional `heap_size_bytes` field, but VM does not allocate or manage heap regions. Dynamic allocation support is incomplete.
- **Performance targets (4.9):** Design goal of 2-4M instructions/second on M4 @ 48MHz cannot be validated without C port
- **Trace APIs (6.1, 7.1):** Design specifies `vm_get_last_pc()`, `vm_get_last_opcode()`, and `vm_get_last_regs()` for executive-side trace capture. Python VM stores some trace state but APIs are not formally exposed per design spec.
- **`vm_reg_get_for` and `vm_reg_set_for` (6.1.1):** Optional APIs for reading/writing registers of non-active PIDs are not implemented

**Deferred Features:**
- **Value service (module 0x07):** Specified in `docs/hsx_value_interface.md` but marked "Planned" in `docs/abi_syscalls.md`. Not exposed by Python VM yet.
- **Command service (module 0x08):** Also marked "Planned" in syscall table. Design references but not implemented.
- **Advanced paging modes:** Code prefetch, double-buffering, and data paging with TLB management are optional design features deferred until C port and embedded deployment
- **Policy flags in mem_cfg (6.1.4):** Design includes policy bitset for controlling `mem_write` in RUN state, `reg_set(PC)` in STOPPED state, etc. Current implementation has no policy enforcement framework.

**Documentation Gaps:**
- Missing formal API documentation for Python VM's public interface (method signatures, return types, error codes)
- No migration guide for applications moving between Python and future C implementations
- Performance benchmarking methodology not documented (how to validate 2-4M instr/s target)
- Missing examples of `mem_cfg` usage with different resource budgets
