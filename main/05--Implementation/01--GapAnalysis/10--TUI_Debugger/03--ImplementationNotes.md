# TUI Debugger - Implementation Notes

Use this log to capture session-by-session progress. Keep entries concise but thorough enough for the next agent to continue immediately.

## Session Template

```
## YYYY-MM-DD - Name/Initials (Session N)

### Scope
- Plan item / phase addressed:
- Design sections reviewed:

### Work Summary
- Key decisions & code changes:
- Design updates filed/applied:

### Testing
- Commands/demos executed + results:
- Issues encountered:

### Next Steps
- Follow-ups / blockers:
- Reviews or coordination required:
```

Append sessions chronologically and ensure every entry ties work back to the design references and documents executed tests.
## 2025-11-02 - Codex Note
- Align TUI task list with executive metadata (app names + summary counts) once Phase 2.0 Task List Metadata lands; reuse CLI formatting so panels highlight declarative resources consistently.
