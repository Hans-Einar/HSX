# Executive Implementation Notes

Use this file to record progress per session.

## Template

```
## YYYY-MM-DD - Name/Initials (Session N)

### Focus
- Task(s) tackled: ...
- Dependencies touched: ...

### Status
- TODO / IN PROGRESS / DONE / BLOCKED

### Details
- Summary of code changes / key decisions.
- Tests run (commands + result).
- Follow-up actions / hand-off notes.
```

Start new sections chronologically. Keep notes concise but actionable so the next agent can resume quickly.
## 2025-11-02 - Codex Note
- Align TUI task list with executive metadata (app names + summary counts) once Phase 2.0 Task List Metadata lands; reuse CLI formatting so panels highlight declarative resources consistently.
