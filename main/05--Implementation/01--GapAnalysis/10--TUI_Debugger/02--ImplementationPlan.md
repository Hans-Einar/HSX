# TUI Debugger Implementation Plan

## Planned Implementation Order (Grand Plan)

1. Phase 1 - Foundation work after the CLI debugger stabilizes (shared services, layout).
2. Phase 2 - Core TUI views for tasks, registers, breakpoints, and mailboxes.
3. Phase 3 - Live update plumbing using executive event streaming.
4. Phase 4 - UX polish, documentation, and regression coverage.
5. Phase 5 - Packaging and distribution planning (deferred until Python flows settle).

## Sprint Scope

Deliver the Python-focused work in Phases 1 through 4. Keep Phase 5 packaging (and any future native ports) out of scope for this sprint while capturing discoveries for later scheduling.

## Overview

This implementation plan addresses the gaps identified in the TUI Debugger Study document ([01--Study.md](./01--Study.md)). The plan is organized chronologically with clear dependencies tracked in [DependencyTree.md](../DependencyTree.md).

**Design Reference:** [04.10--TUI_Debugger.md](../../../04--Design/04.10--TUI_Debugger.md)

**Note:** Complete TUI is missing. This plan builds a full-screen terminal debugger using Textual framework.
