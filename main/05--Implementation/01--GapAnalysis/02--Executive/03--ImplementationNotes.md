## 2025-11-01 - Codex (Session 1)

### Focus
- Task(s) tackled: Implement Phase 1 session management (session.open/keepalive/close, PID locks, heartbeat/feature negotiation).
- Dependencies touched: `python/execd.py`, `docs/executive_protocol.md`, new unit tests under `python/tests/`.

### Status
- DONE

### Details
- Summary of code changes / key decisions.
  - Added session registry with lock enforcement and timeout pruning in `python/execd.py:37-255`.
  - Wired TCP handler to honour session contexts and reject PID operations without ownership (`python/execd.py:993-1188`).
  - Documented clamped capability warnings + lock semantics (`docs/executive_protocol.md:142-206`).
  - Added pytest coverage for session lifecycles and lock enforcement (`python/tests/test_executive_sessions.py`).
- Tests run (commands + result).
  - `python -m pytest python/tests/test_executive_sessions.py` → PASS
- Follow-up actions / hand-off notes.
  - Shell/executive clients must attach sessions before sending PID-specific RPCs.

## 2025-11-01 - Codex (Session 2)

### Focus
- Task(s) tackled: Implement Phase 1 event streaming foundation (bounded queues, subscribe/unsubscribe/ack, warning events).
- Dependencies touched: `python/execd.py`, `docs/executive_protocol.md`, `python/tests/test_executive_sessions.py`.

### Status
- DONE

### Details
- Summary of code changes / key decisions.
  - Added fan-out broadcaster with per-session filters, queue limits, ACK handling, and warning emissions (`python/execd.py:305-520`, `python/execd.py:949-1009`, `python/execd.py:1210-1262`).
  - Streamlined `_ShellHandler` to support long-lived event streams via subscription tokens.
  - Updated protocol doc with subscription token semantics and teardown behaviour (`docs/executive_protocol.md:164-200`).
  - Extended pytest suite with event delivery, ack, and overflow scenarios.
- Tests run (commands + result).
  - `python -m pytest python/tests/test_executive_sessions.py` → PASS
- Follow-up actions / hand-off notes.
  - Update shell clients (`python/shell_client.py`, `python/blinkenlights.py`, etc.) to negotiate sessions, send keepalives, and consume the streaming socket.


## 2025-11-01 - Codex (Session 3)

### Focus
- Task(s) tackled: Wire shell/blinkenlights/manager smoke clients to new session/event-stream APIs via `ExecutiveSession` helper; expose event buffers in CLI.
- Dependencies touched: `python/shell_client.py`, `python/blinkenlights.py`, `python/exec_smoke.py`, `python/hsx_manager.py`, new `python/executive_session.py` module, documentation/help assets.

### Status
- DONE

### Details
- Summary of code changes / key decisions.
  - Introduced shared `ExecutiveSession` helper for session negotiation, keepalive, and event streaming; replaced ad-hoc socket usage across CLI utilities.
  - Updated shell client to auto-open sessions, maintain an event buffer, add an `events` command, and refresh help topics; blinkenlights/manager/exec_smoke reuse the helper.
  - Added small help stubs (`help/events.txt`, `help/bp.txt`) to document new commands.
- Tests run (commands + result).
  - `python -m pytest python/tests/test_executive_sessions.py` → PASS
- Follow-up actions / hand-off notes.
  - Port remaining debugger frontends (TUI/VSCode) to `ExecutiveSession` during their milestones.

## 2025-11-01 - Codex (Session 4)

### Focus
- Task(s) tackled: Phase 1 breakpoint management (exec-side data structures, RPC exposure, CLI/doc/test coverage).
- Dependencies touched: `python/execd.py`, `python/shell_client.py`, `docs/executive_protocol.md`, `python/tests/test_executive_sessions.py`.

### Status
- DONE

### Details
- Summary of code changes / key decisions.
  - Added per-PID breakpoint tracking with VM debug attach/detach helpers plus new `bp` RPC handling (list/set/clear/clear_all).
  - Extended shell client with a dedicated `bp` command, pretty-printer, and documentation; updated protocol docs accordingly.
  - Added unit tests using a debug VM stub to validate add/list/clear flows and local state updates.
- Tests run (commands + result).
  - `python -m pytest python/tests/test_executive_sessions.py` → PASS
- Follow-up actions / hand-off notes.
  - Surface breakpoint info in downstream debugger UI/UX components in later milestones.
