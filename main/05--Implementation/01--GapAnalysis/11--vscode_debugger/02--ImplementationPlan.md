# VS Code Debugger Implementation Plan

## Overview

This implementation plan addresses the gaps identified in the VS Code Debugger Study document ([01--Study.md](./01--Study.md)). The plan is organized chronologically with clear dependencies tracked in [DependencyTree.md](../DependencyTree.md).

**Design Reference:** [04.11--vscode_debugger.md](../../../04--Design/04.11--vscode_debugger.md)
