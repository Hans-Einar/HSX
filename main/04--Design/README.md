# Design Document Set

Detailed design specs live here; each file expands on the corresponding architecture view.

- [(4.1) VM](04.01--VM.md) — MiniVM internals.
- [(4.2) Executive](04.02--Executive.md) — Executive control and RPC implementation.
- [(4.3) Mailbox](04.03--Mailbox.md) — Mailbox data structures and flows.
- [(4.4) ValCmd](04.04--ValCmd.md) — Value/command runtime implementation.
- [(4.5) Toolchain](04.05--Toolchain.md) — LLVM lowering, assembler, linker, packaging.
- [(4.6) Toolkit](04.06--Toolkit.md) — Shell/debugger internals.
- [(4.7) Provisioning](04.07--Provisioning.md) — Provisioning and persistence mechanisms.

Add further specs (HAL, security) when deeper design work begins.
