### T4 Tests, docs, demos (`not started`)
- [ ] Create/extend unit tests: register-window isolation, stack overflow, trap resume, RR fairness.
- [ ] Update integration tests/demos (mailbox producer/consumer) to assert behaviour under new scheduler.
- [ ] Refresh documentation (`docs/hsx_spec-v2.md`, CLI help) to reflect "one step = one instruction" and base-pointer model.
- [ ] Capture evidence: `dumpregs`, `mbox`, scheduler stats before/after refactor.
- [ ] Coordinate final review and stakeholder sign-off.
