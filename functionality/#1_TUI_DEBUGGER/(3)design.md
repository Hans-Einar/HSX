# Feature Design â€” HSX Debugger Toolkit & TUI

> Detailed specification for the agreed solution. Update if implementation deviates.

## Overview
- Draft design pending completion of the feature study. This document will capture the agreed debugger architecture, interfaces, and rollout plan.
- Link back to `(2)study.md` for discovery notes and option analysis.

## Architecture & Components
- **Affected areas:** `python/execd.py` (RPC), new debugger package (CLI/REPL/TUI), potential MiniVM direct interface (`platforms/python/host_vm.py`), documentation/help assets.
- **Data flow:** _TBD._
- **Interfaces / APIs:** _TBD._

## Detailed Design
### 1. Core debugger engine (_TBD_)
- Describe session management, transport abstraction, state synchronisation.
- Pseudocode / diagrams to be added once approach is chosen.

### 2. CLI / scripting interface (_TBD_)
- Command structure, argument parsing, exit codes.

### 3. Interactive shell (_TBD_)
- Command set, history, auto-completion, context awareness.

### 4. TUI front-end (_TBD_)
- Layout (register panel, trace, disassembly, auxiliary widgets), update cadence, keyboard controls.

## Compatibility & Migration
- Backward compatibility considerations with existing HSX shell clients.
- Packaging/distribution implications for Windows/macOS/Linux.
- Feature flagging or phased rollout plan once design is finalised.

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests: core session logic, command parsing, data transforms.
- Integration tests: attach to `execd` and MiniVM, exercise CLI and TUI flows.
- Manual validation checklist for cross-platform terminals.

## Documentation Updates
- User guides for CLI, shell, and TUI usage.
- Developer docs outlining API extension points.
- Help text for new commands.

## Risks & Mitigations
- _To be enumerated once design decisions are final._

## Sign-off
- Design approved by: `<pending>`
- Date: `<pending>`
