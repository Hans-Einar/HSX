# Feature Study â€” `<working title>`

> Purpose: capture the baseline behaviour, explore solution options, and agree on the approach before detailed design.

## Study Participants
- Lead: `<name>`
- Contributors / reviewers: `<names>`
- Date(s): `<YYYY-MM-DD>`

## Current Behaviour / Baseline
- Describe how the system behaves today.
- Include relevant code paths, data flows, or user interactions.
- Note any known limitations, bugs, or tech debt that motivated this feature.
- Highlight how the requested functionality maps onto current behaviour and identify gaps.

### Supporting Evidence
- Logs / traces: `<path or summary>`
- CLI output / screenshots: `<references>`
- Existing tests covering the area: `<files>`

## Solution Options
| Option | Description | Pros | Cons / Risks |
|--------|-------------|------|--------------|
| A | `<short summary>` | `<benefits>` | `<trade-offs>` |
| B |  |  |  |

## Decision
- **Chosen approach:** `<Option X>`
- **Rationale:** `<why this path>`
- **Open questions:** `<items requiring follow-up>`
- **Dependencies:** `<other teams, releases, infra>`

## Next Steps
- Update `(3)design.md` with detailed plan.
- Capture any quick wins or prerequisite refactors.
- Schedule stakeholder review if needed.
