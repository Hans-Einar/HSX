# Mailbox Update Verification Summary

## Runtime Evidence
- `mailbox_baseline.md` now includes a post-fix transcript (section D) showing:
  - consumer stdout announcing `mailbox consumer listening on app:procon`.
  - producer stdin handling `hello` and draining the shared queue (`mbox ns app`).
  - manual `clock step` counters demonstrating instruction-based scheduling.

## Documentation & Help
- `docs/hsx_spec-v2.md` documents namespace rules and the step-based executive controls (lines 171-189, 153-163).
- `help/mbox.txt` and `help/clock.txt` describe namespace filters, PID suffix usage, and per-PID stepping.
- `examples/demos/mailbox/README.md` walks through building, stepping, sending, and inspecting the demo under the updated tooling.

## Tests Executed
- `PYTHONPATH=. pytest python/tests/test_mailbox_svc_runtime.py` (covers namespace reuse, fanout, recv info struct, timeouts).
- Manual demo run via `python/shell_client.py` (transcript captured in `mailbox_baseline.md`).

## Pending Follow-ups
- None for the mailbox scheduler/namespace work; demo artefacts, docs, and automated tests are aligned with the new step semantics.
