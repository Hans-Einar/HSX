# Refactor Package Template

Use this folder as a starting point when launching a new refactor initiative.  
Copy it (renumbering the directory) and fill in each numbered document as the effort progresses.

Suggested order of work:
1. Capture the problem snapshot in `(0)context.md`.
2. Define goals, scope, and success measurements in `(1)objectives.md`.
3. Audit current behaviour and risks in `(2)analysis.md`.
4. Record the concrete requirements in `(3)requirements.md`.
5. Draft proposed changes in `(4)design.md`.
6. Maintain acceptance checks in `(5)dod.md`.
7. Track execution tasks in `(6)implementation.md`.
8. Summarise commits / PRs in `(7)git.md`.

Feel free to add or remove files as needed, but keep the numbering so the documents stay ordered.
