# BACKLOG

Items we want to track, but which are not currently on the active TODO list:

- Add explicit CRC regression tests for asm.py/hld.py pipeline (verify header + data checksums).
- Expand floating-point coverage (f32?f16 conversions, mixed-precision code paths).
- Document and design debugger tooling (breakpoints, single-step UX) as part of the upcoming milestone planning.
