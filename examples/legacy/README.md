# Legacy Examples and Scripts

This directory preserves the original batch-driven toolchain experiments and flat HSX artefacts. They remain available for reference, but the active workflow lives in `examples/tests/` and is orchestrated by the Makefiles.

- `tests_flat/` contains historical `.mvasm/.hxe` outputs generated by the batch scripts.
- `*.bat` files mirror the early pipeline runners; prefer the Make targets described in `docs/REFACTOR_PLAN.md`.

Nothing in this directory participates in automated builds.
