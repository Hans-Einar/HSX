events: show recent executive events.

Usage:
  events [count]

Displays the most recent streamed events captured by the current session
(default 10 entries). Use `--json` to emit raw JSON payloads instead of the
compact summary view.

Task state transitions are summarised as `task_state` entries of the form
`prev -> new reason=<...>` with optional details (e.g., mailbox descriptors,
exit status) when the executive records `mailbox_wait`, `timeout`, `returned`,
or `killed` transitions.
