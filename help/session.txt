session [list|close <id|number>]
Show or manage executive sessions.

Examples
  session             # show the current session id details
  session list        # list all sessions with numeric identifiers
  session close 3     # close the session numbered 3
  session close id:abcd-1234  # close a specific session by id

Notes
- The ``session list`` output assigns numbers starting at 1; use these
  numbers with ``session close`` or the ``dmesg session`` filter.
- Sessions may only be terminated by clients that still hold an active
  session with the executive.
