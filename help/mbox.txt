mbox [filters]
=============

List known mailboxes. Without filters every descriptor is shown. Optional filters:

- `all`                    force a full dump even if filters were previously applied
- `pid <n>` / `owner <n>`  limit to descriptors owned by PID `<n>` (alias: `pid=<n>`)
- `ns <name>`              limit to namespace (`pid`, `svc`, `app`, `shared`)
- `app|shared|svc`         shorthand namespace filters

Tips
----

- `svc:` mailboxes accept `@<pid>` suffixes (e.g. `svc:stdio.out@3`) to inspect another task's stdio channel.
- `app:` targets without a suffix are global; append `@<pid>` to scope binding to a specific owner.
- `shared:` targets are always global and may advertise fan-out policies.

Examples
--------

- `mbox`                     # list the full descriptor table
- `mbox all`                 # reset filters and show everything
- `mbox pid 3`               # descriptors owned by PID 3
- `mbox shared`              # globally shared mailboxes
- `mbox ns app owner 7`      # app: mailboxes attributed to PID 7
- `mbox pid=0 ns shared`     # host-side shared mailboxes
