trace <pid> [on|off]
trace <pid> records [limit]
trace config changed-regs <on|off>
trace config buffer <size>

Toggle instruction tracing for the specified task. Without a mode it flips the current state; use 'on' or 'off' to force a value.

`trace <pid> records` dumps the most recent trace entries for that task (optionally limiting how many entries are returned).

`trace config` adjusts global trace settings. Use `trace config changed-regs off` to suppress per-instruction register diffs (and `... on` to re-enable them). `trace config buffer <size>` changes the per-task ring buffer capacity (set size=0 to disable retention).
