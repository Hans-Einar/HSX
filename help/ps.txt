ps [pid]

Display the scheduler task table with PID, state, priority, quantum, steps, trace state,
and app name. When the executive exposes metadata (values/commands/mailboxes), the column
is appended so you can spot declarative resources at a glance.

Passing a PID prints detailed information for that task, including registers and metadata
counts when available.
