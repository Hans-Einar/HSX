# HSX Executive and Virtual Machine Specification ‚Äî Version 2

## Overview
The HSX system is a hybrid between a **virtual machine (VM)** and an **executive kernel**. 
It is designed for embedded devices such as AVR microcontrollers, providing portable execution 
of ‚Äúdomain applications‚Äù written in C and compiled through the HSX toolchain into `.hxe` binaries.

HSX separates into two main layers:

1. **HSX Virtual Machine (VM)** ‚Äî Executes machine instructions, manages registers and memory.
2. **HSX Executive (Executive Kernel)** ‚Äî Manages scheduling, tasks, mailboxes, and syscalls.

This design allows HSX applications to run identically across hardware and simulated environments.

## HSX Virtual Machine

### Responsibilities
- Executes HSX instruction set (MVASM).
- Maintains memory map and register windows.
- Handles instruction decoding, arithmetic, logic, branching, and FPU ops (F16/F32).
- Provides syscall entry (SVC) as the interface to the executive or host backend.

### Register Model
All HSX registers reside in memory. The VM references a **register base pointer** (RBP) that defines 
the memory region representing the active register file. 

Context switching in the executive simply updates the VM‚Äôs RBP to point to another task‚Äôs register block ‚Äî 
no copying required.

```text
struct VMState {
    uint16_t pc;
    uint16_t reg_base;  // pointer to active register window
    uint8_t  flags;
};
```

Switching tasks is done by reassigning `vm.reg_base` to another region of memory.

### Syscall Interface
Syscalls (`SVC`) trigger VM traps. The VM passes `mod`, `fn`, and register state to the backend handler.  
Modules are grouped by function ‚Äî e.g. FS (0x4), CAN (0x2), Mailbox (0x5), and so on.

The backend may handle these directly (native code on AVR, Python simulation) or pass them to the Executive.

## HSX Executive

### Purpose
The Executive acts as the operating system for HSX applications. It runs within the VM, in C, and controls:
- Task management and scheduling.
- IPC and Mailboxes.
- Memory allocation and process management.
- Dispatch of syscalls to devices, filesystem, and CAN.

### Memory Model
All code and data live in a shared address space. Each task gets its own **register window** and **stack region**.  
The Executive maintains a task table mapping task IDs to these regions.

| Field | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| `pid` | Process ID |
| `state` | Ready / Running / Waiting |
| `reg_base` | Base address for register window |
| `stack_ptr` | Current stack pointer |
| `mailbox_mask` | Accessible mailbox handles |

---

## üì® Mailbox Subsystem

### Overview
Mailboxes are shared kernel-managed message queues that enable inter-process communication.  
They are inspired by RSX-11 and VMS mailboxes, but simplified for embedded systems.

Mailboxes are owned and managed by the Executive ‚Äî not by individual HSX applications.

### Data Model
| Field | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| `id` | Mailbox handle |
| `name` | Optional symbolic name |
| `owner_pid` | PID of creating process |
| `capacity` | Number of messages |
| `queue[]` | Message descriptors (size, sender, payload pointer) |
| `read_idx` / `write_idx` | Circular buffer indices |
| `wait_list` | Tasks blocked on receive |

### Syscalls (Module 0x5)

| Syscall | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| `MAILBOX_CREATE(name, capacity)` | Creates or opens a mailbox |
| `MAILBOX_SEND(handle, ptr, len)` | Sends a message |
| `MAILBOX_RECV(handle, ptr, maxlen)` | Receives a message (may block) |
| `MAILBOX_PEEK(handle)` | Checks if message is available |
| `MAILBOX_CLOSE(handle)` | Closes a mailbox handle |

### Scheduling Integration
If a task blocks on `MAILBOX_RECV()`, the Executive sets its state to **waiting**.  
When a message arrives, the sender signals the scheduler, which places the waiting task in the ready queue.

Because the VM uses register-base switching, resuming the task only requires setting `vm.reg_base` to its register block.

---

## Scheduler
- **Mode:** Cooperative round-robin (upgradeable to pre-emptive with timer SVCs).
- **Context Switch:** Performed by swapping register base pointer and stack pointer.
- **Yield Mechanism:** Tasks can call `SVC_YIELD()` to allow others to run.

---

## Device Drivers and Syscalls

The Executive uses existing SVC module numbers to map system calls to the underlying hardware.

| Module | Purpose | Example |
|----------|----------|----------|
| `0x1` | System | Exit, sleep, time |
| `0x2` | CAN | CAN TX/RX |
| `0x3` | OS / Exec | Process control (exec, kill, wait) |
| `0x4` | FS | File read/write |
| `0x5` | Mailbox | Interprocess communication |
| `0x6` | UART | Serial console I/O |

Each module may be backed by host functions in Python or native C code on embedded targets.

---

## HSX OS and Native Integration

The Executive may be compiled both:
1. **As part of the HSX VM (for simulation)** ‚Äî implemented in Python, running `.hxe` applications.  
2. **As native C code** on AVR ‚Äî integrated with hardware peripherals for CAN, UART, and SD card.

Applications written for HSX can therefore run unmodified across hardware and virtual targets.

---

## Portability and HAL Layer

The hardware abstraction layer (HAL) defines interfaces for:
- UART, CAN, and Filesystem
- Timers and Sleep
- Memory allocation and interrupts

Each HAL function is defined in C headers so the same Executive code can be recompiled for different MCU architectures.

---

## Example Integration Flow

1. **VM Startup** ‚Äî Initialize memory and load Executive.
2. **Executive Init** ‚Äî Create kernel mailboxes, init scheduler, spawn domain apps.
3. **Task Switch** ‚Äî Executive updates `vm.reg_base` ‚Üí new register window.
4. **Syscall Trap** ‚Äî `SVC` instruction transfers control to the Executive.
5. **Mailbox Event** ‚Äî Task A sends message ‚Üí Task B wakes up.
6. **Shutdown / Exit** ‚Äî Executive terminates and signals VM halt.
